## Homework1
This is Homework 1 for Edge-AI.

### 1. Logistics & Deadline & Grading

#### 1.1 Introduction
After grasping the basics of PyTorch APIs and deep learning development pipeline, in this very homework, you are required to dive even deeper into the world of Edge-AI.

#### 1.2 Deadline
Homework1 is released on Mar. 21 (2024.3.21)

<b>Deadline: Apr. 7 (2024.4.7)</b>
<b>Delay Policy: -5/day delayed</b>

#### 1.3 Grading
<b>Try Hard & No need to struggle on the correctness!</b> TA wants to know how you understand the problem. You can still earn 100, as long as you dump your meaningful thoughts towards the problems, no matter they are correct or not. 
(You won't lose points due to your errors, but you'll pay for your laziness!)

Grading Policy:

A+ (100): Excellent, TA can understand what you mean, most of the time.
A (95+): Good, TA can understand at least half of your answers.
A- (90+): Not Bad, at least you've said something correct.
B (80+): Hard work, you've finished your homework, though TA can't understand your answers.
(80-): You've only finished part of your job.

(Suggestion: If you spend <b>5 hours or more</b>, you will definitely earn 95+.)
